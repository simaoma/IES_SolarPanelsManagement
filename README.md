## **Context**

In this repository you will find our project SolarLink that was made in the context of Introduction to Software Engineering course.

In it, we propose, conceptualize, and implement a solution for a Household Solar grid management system.


## **Deploy**
Unfortunately due to an error, we were not able to deploy the frontend part of the project.

So to run the application you need to download the frontend folder and do as the 'README.md', that is inside that folder, says to be able to try our application.
